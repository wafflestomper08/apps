Applet: NASA APOD
Summary: NASA's daily space picture
Description: NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day, full bleed on the matrix.
Author: nsluke

The spirit of Tidbyt's first-party JWST app, pointed at the richer daily
source. One picture a day, edge to edge, with the title on a translucent
strip along the bottom.

Data: https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod (thumbs=true). Verified by hand
before this was written; field notes that differ from folklore:
  - api.nasa.gov sits behind api-umbrella and answers anywhere from 0.3s to
    5.5s, against pixlet's ~5s http deadline. A blown deadline is a TRANSPORT
    error, which aborts the whole render: Starlark never gets control back,
    so no amount of downstream fallback runs. Everything here is arranged so
    that costs at most one render in a while, never the next one too:
      * a cold-cache first render draws the starfield without any network at
        all (BOOT_HOLD), while still serving anything already cached;
      * once today's entry is in hand nothing is fetched again until
        tomorrow - APOD is immutable once published, so a render that has
        the picture has nothing to win and a whole render to lose;
      * the gate key that bounds a hanging dependency is written BEFORE the
        request and held longer than the app's own 240s cadence (much longer
        when there is a good picture to fall back on), so a failed attempt
        genuinely suppresses the following renders instead of every one of
        them repeating it.
  - Video days do NOT reliably have thumbnail_url: YouTube embeds do,
    self-hosted .mp4 days return thumbnail_url of "" (empty string).
    Those fall back to the starfield title card with a play glyph.
  - DEMO_KEY is rate limited per IP (observed x-ratelimit-limit: 10 per
    window). Harmless at a 6h fresh TTL; heavy users can paste their own
    free key.

Source images are often multi-megabyte, so they are never fetched raw:
images.weserv.nl resizes server-side to exactly the panel's own size (~800
bytes of baseline JPEG for a 64x32 panel, ~1.3 KB for a 64x64 one, both
verified end to end). Bytes that render.Image cannot decode are the other
uncatchable abort, so they are decoded BEFORE they reach the 3-day cache,
and a cached entry is demoted to a 1s TTL for exactly as long as it spends
in the decoder. A bad picture can cost one render; it can never replay from
cache for three days.

On a square (64x64) panel the app asks the proxy for a 64x64 crop instead of
a 64x32 one, so roughly twice the photograph survives - still full bleed,
still with the title strip along the bottom, but 57 rows of sky under it
rather than 25. The requested size is part of the image cache key, or the
two panel shapes would serve each other's crops.
