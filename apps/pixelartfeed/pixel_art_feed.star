"""
Pixel Art Feed.

Shows artwork from r/PixelArt. Picks a post from the chosen feed, pulls the
full-resolution original from i.redd.it, and scales it to the panel with
nearest-neighbour so the pixels stay pixels. No API key required.

Art that isn't the shape of the panel is panned rather than squashed: tall
pieces drift top to bottom, panoramas left to right, with a beat of
stillness at each end. Animated GIFs keep animating while they pan.

Reddit's .json API is bot-blocked (403) but the Atom feeds are open, so this
reads .rss and parses it with xpath. Anonymous reddit allows roughly one
request a minute, so the parsed post list is cached and reused across
renders rather than fetched per frame.

KNOWN LIMITATION: reddit also blocks by TLS fingerprint, and the fingerprint
Go presents depends on whether the CPU has hardware AES. Hosts without it —
every Raspberry Pi, whose ARM cores lack the crypto extensions — get a 403
block page from reddit.com no matter what this app sends, while x86 hosts
are served normally. Nothing here can change that, so those hosts can point
"Feed mirror" at something on their own network that fetches the feed with a
client reddit accepts (curl, python) and serves it back over plain HTTP.

# Anonymous reddit allows roughly one feed read a minute and answers a
# lasting block page to anything that keeps pushing past it, while a device
# re-renders its apps every rotation pass. So the parsed post list is held
# in cache.star rather than re-fetched per render: one read feeds hours of
# renders, and the art still changes every time because a post is drawn at
# random from the ~70 in the list.
#
# This is deliberately cache.star and not http ttl_seconds alone. ttl_seconds
# caches the response, but a non-200 is only held for 5s, so a blocked or
# rate-limited feed would be retried on every render — and there would be
# nothing to draw in the meantime. Caching the parsed list instead gives two
# useful TTLs: FRESH_TTL is when a refresh is attempted, STALE_TTL is how
# long the existing list stays usable, and between them the app keeps
# showing known-good art while it retries. FAIL_COOLDOWN backs a failed
# feed off rather than hammering it.
