Applet: GTA 6 Countdown
Summary: Counts down to GTA 6
Description: Days, hours, minutes and seconds until Grand Theft Auto VI on 19 November 2026. Runs to midnight in your own timezone, and takes a target date of your own if the release moves again.
Author: nsluke

A LukeByt original.

The lockup is a hand-drawn numeral that runs cobalt into hot pink into amber
down its own height, rimmed in gold at the top and deep purple at the point.
Every glyph in the file is an original bitmap drawn as run-length boxes: no
font files, no game assets, nothing lifted.

Rockstar has announced the date but never an hour, which is why the clock runs
to local midnight, and the date is a config field because this release has
already moved twice.

# Hero numerals at cap 13: 3px stems, a 3px counter and a 3px bar. Most are a
# solid block with slots cut out of one edge; 0, 6, 8 and 9 keep an enclosed
# counter, the 4 is the only wide one, and the 7 owns the only diagonal.
#
# Two deliberate departures from the heavy display faces this is reaching for.
# Theirs run a counter barely a pixel wide, which at 1:1 closes under an LED
# panel's bloom until 0 and 8 are the same white slab; three pixels costs a
# little weight and buys twenty pixels of difference between them. And theirs
# draw the 1 as a bare stem, which is fine on a poster and unreadable on a
# counter that spends its last fortnight showing 19, 11 and 1, so this one
# takes a flag.
